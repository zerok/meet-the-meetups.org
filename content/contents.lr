title: Meet The Meetups
---
body: Meet The Meetups is an experiment to bring all the technical user-groups in a city closer together. Back in 2015 we started off with a BBQ party in Graz with members of the local Agile/Scrum, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, UX, and other user-groups, sponsored by [Netconomy Software & Consulting](https://netconomy.net).
